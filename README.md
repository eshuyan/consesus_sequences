# consesus_sequences

## 1. Motivation 
## When a protein module binds to the others, it usually reconganizes similar sequence motifs. The aim and motivation of this programme is to do a worm whole protein sequence search for consesus sequences.

## 2. Design Version 1
### (1): Download protein fasta sequence from NCBI;
### (2): Parse fasta file, and save protein info into a dictionary.
### (3): Using regular expression to find motif of interest.


##3. Version Control
This version is totally functional. But will re-write the protein infor to a sql database
